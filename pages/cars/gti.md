# Project car

My current project is a 2002 (Mk. 4) Volkswagen GTI 1.8T. It's one of only a very small number which have had the "Jolf" aesthetic modification, which swaps the hood, fenders, bumpers, and headlights with those from a Jetta.

## History

I bought the car in September of 2013 from a good friend who loved the thing to death, but decided he needed to do some financial belt-tightening in the form of a cheaper car. When I got the GTI, it had quite a few problems, including a cracked windshield, power steering leak, PCV system leak, bent passenger-side front strut, worn control arms and bushings, and a decaying interior with no driver's side floor mat and caked-on dust and grime everywhere.

During the 3 months I was driving it, I fixed everything and made it a car you could be proud of again.

Then I drove it to Jersey to pick up a Craigslist find, and as I was getting off of the highway, a loud clunking sound came from the motor. I ripped off the timing cover and felt the belt. It was loose.

Ultimately what killed the valves was a weak bolt on the idler pulley, which is driven by the timing belt. The bolt snapped in half, halting force transmission to the camshafts and causing the pistons to collide with the valves.

## Under the hood

The car came stock with a ~180HP turbocharged 1.8L straight-four motor, engine code AWP. I'm planning to acquire a cylinder head from an earlier revision of the motor, code AEB, which has larger intake ports. Once that's in I can install larger fuel injectors and tune the car to run on E85 or do other weird evil modifications.

Other mods to the GTI (most done by the previous two owners) include:

* GIAC X+ tune
* Techtonics cams
* Forge 007 diverter valve
* ECS Tuning N75H valve (wastegate frequency control)
* 034 Motorsport reinforced silicone PCV hose kit
* SuperPro polyurethane steering rack bushing
* Custom 2.5" catback exhaust
* Red coilpacks from the later 2.0T
* Polished black valve cover
* White painted Montreal II wheels (summer)
* Black painted 15" steel wheels with Firestone Winterforce tires (winter)
* D2S projector headlights with custom housings
* KYB adjustable sport front suspension

With the above modifications, the car was pushing about 250hp by the previous owner's estimate. I did not update the tune while I was driving it, and the mods I did were largely maintenance upgrades. Unfortunately, I never got to dyno it either.

## The plan

I have plans to rebuild the motor in late spring/early summer 2014. First, the cylinder head will be removed to see if there is any damage to the pistons - if so, a full motor swap or rebuild will be necessary.

If the head can be replaced without dropping the motor, I'll get a remanufactured AEB head and supporting equipment and get the car back on the road hopefully by fall of 2014.

I'm not sure what my plan is for the GTI after the rebuild. On the one hand, owning a backup car is nice, but insurance is expensive, and the GTI and MS3 are both "hot hatches." I definitely don't want to give it up though, because the car has remained in the same circle of friends since it was new, and it's one of the most unique looking Mk4s out there.
