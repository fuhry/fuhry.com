# Daily driver

My daily driver is a 2009 (generation 1) Mazdaspeed 3 in Metropolitan Gray Mica, purchased in December of 2013.

Right now, the motor is bone stock, but when you look at what it comes with, you'll see why:

* 2.3L straight-four DOHC, turbocharged, 274hp
* Transverse mounted front-wheel drive
* Limited-slip differential
* Six speed manual transmission with short shifter

## Powertrain mods

I'm planning the following powertrain modifications to start with:

* [Cobb short ram air intake](http://www.cobbtuning.com/MAZDASPEED3-SF-Intake-Kit-p/771500.htm)
* [Cobb Accessport tuner](http://www.cobbtuning.com/MAZDASPEED-Accessport-V3-p/ap3-maz-002.htm)
* Front-mount intercooler (FMIC) swap **or** a [scooped hood](http://www.streetunit.com/DG_Motorsports_Vented_Hood_for_07_09_Mazdaspeed_3_p/dgms32gh.htm)

## Audio system

It came with the BOSE sound system, and nobody likes BOSE, so I replaced the amplifier and speakers and added a sub, as follows:

* Amplifiers: Alpine MRV-F300 (mid/high); Alpine MRV-M500 (sub)
* Front speakers: Infinity Reference 6030cs
* Rear speakers: Infinity Reference 6832cf
* Subwoofer: Alpine SWS-12D4
* Currently running the stock head unit

The wiring job of course looks like it was done by a networking major. A specific wiring harness, Metra's model 70-2003, says it's made for GM vehicles but also functions as the "amplifier" side of the BOSE audio feed, meaning I was able to build a harness that plugs directly into the OEM connector. Buy two - it only comes with 14 pins and you need 17.
