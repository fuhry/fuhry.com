# Daily driver

My daily driver is a 2009 (generation 1) Mazdaspeed 3 in Metropolitan Gray Mica, purchased in December of 2013.

Right now, the motor is mostly stock, but when you look at what it comes with, you'll see why:

* 2.3L straight-four DOHC, turbocharged, 274hp
* Transverse mounted front-wheel drive
* Limited-slip differential
* Six speed manual transmission with short shifter

## Powertrain mods

I've made the following modifications thus far:

* [Corksport Stage 2 short-ram air intake and turbo inlet pipe](http://www.corksport.com/corksport-power-series-short-ram-intake-2010-mazdaspeed-3.html)
* [Corksport urethane race rear motor mount](http://www.corksport.com/corksport-mazdaspeed-3-mazda-3-race-rear-motor-mount.html)


The following are planned once the budget allows:

* [Cobb Accessport tuner](http://www.cobbtuning.com/MAZDASPEED-Accessport-V3-p/ap3-maz-002.htm)
* Front-mount intercooler (FMIC) swap **or** a [scooped hood](http://www.streetunit.com/DG_Motorsports_Vented_Hood_for_07_09_Mazdaspeed_3_p/dgms32gh.htm)
* [Corksport's turboback exhaust](http://www.corksport.com/corksport-power-series-mazdaspeed-3-turbo-back-exhaust-system.html) (maybe... I don't like it too loud/obnoxious)

## Audio system

It came with the BOSE sound system, and nobody likes BOSE, so I replaced the amplifier and speakers and added a sub, as follows:

* Amplifiers: Alpine MRV-F300 (mid/high); Alpine MRV-M500 (sub)
* Front speakers: Infinity Reference 6030cs
* Rear speakers: Infinity Reference 6832cf
* Subwoofer: Alpine SWS-12D4
* Currently running the stock head unit

The wiring job of course looks like it was done by a networking major. A specific wiring harness, Metra's model 70-2003, says it's made for GM vehicles but also functions as the "amplifier" side of the BOSE audio feed, meaning I was able to build a harness that plugs directly into the OEM connector. Buy two - it only comes with 14 pins and you need 17.
