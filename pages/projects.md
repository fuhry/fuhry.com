Technical projects
==================

**[Enano CMS](http://enanocms.org/)** - Not as actively developed as I'd like it to be, but this is the project that taught me web development, design, system administration, infrastructure management, vulnerability reporting, the free software ecosystem, and countless other subjects. I still [commit bugfixes](http://hg.enanocms.org/repos/enano-1.1/) every once in a while.
	
**[KCRAP improvements for EAP under Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=53870)** - It occurred to me as I was playing around with WPA enterprise that if you want your Windows clients to be able to use your enterprise WiFi setup without installing additional supplicant software, the only solution was to use Active Directory. This is because Windows clients use MSCHAP version 2 to perform authentication. This was an extensive project in late 2011/early 2012 during which I brought the [<acronym title="Kerberos Challenge-Response Authentication Protocol">KCRAP</acronym>](http://www.spock.org/kcrap/) server and client up to date and modified them to include additional fields relied on for MSCHAPv2 over PEAP. The result is that you can now support Windows clients on your 802.1x-enabled network without buying and installing additional supplicant software and without using Windows servers. Published as an Arch Linux package.

**[OpenWRT Netgear WNR2000 port](https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=18279)** - I made OpenWRT run on Netgear's WNR2000 routers. This includes a repartitioning script which maximizes free space for packages. This project mostly involved scripting but also had a little bit of kernel hacking.

**Full network management/SSO project** - No link for this because sadly it's in too many pieces to really be turned into anything I can release publicly, but my home network is fitted with global single sign-on, a captive portal, DNS/DHCP management, and many services (including shell, web hosting, VM hosting, LDAP/Kerberos, and much more). The network spans multiple sites (my parents' house is tied into it) and all management is fully centralized. The goal is to make every service on my network SSO-friendly. Aside from my immediate family, I give out accounts to friends and have them test/break things in exchange for providing them with reliable free hosting less limited than most options out there.
	
**[Project Blackboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1qLc2DUyL8)** - I chopped up my old Lenovo X41 Tablet and turned it into a status display mounted on my CSH dorm room door. Status is updated by swiping your finger on the X41's fingerprint reader and selecting a new status from a menu. This was mostly web development with some scripting; a program written in C handles the fingerprint acquisition and identification. Credit goes to [Mike Moffitt](http://mikejmoffitt.com/) for the initial idea. I'm no longer in the dorms at RIT, so this project is now dismantled and the X41T now belongs to my sister.
	
**[Package Stalker](/packagestalker)** - A better interface for tracking packages from UPS, FedEx and several other couriers.

Non-technical projects
======================

**[Metal on keys](http://www.youtube.com/user/danfuhry)** - I'm a nut for metal, specifically progressive and neoclassical. Combine that with my tendency to learn music by ear, and occasionally you get to actually writing good piano covers of these songs. The ones on my YouTube channel are those which I thought were good enough to play in front of a camera.
	
**Hi-fi experimentation** - I have a little home studio with speakers I rebuilt myself, and an architecture designed to maximize flexibility for both enjoyable listening and recording.
