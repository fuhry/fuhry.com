Bio
===

## Early life ##

I was born in Cleveland, Ohio in early 1991, and lived in the Cleveland area for my full childhood.

For most of those years I was homeschooled, but when I was 16, halfway through 10th grade, I switched to a local private high
school.

## University ##

I attended Rochester Institute of Technology for a B.S. in Information Security and Forensics. At RIT I was involved with several
student clubs and organizations including [Computer Science House](http://www.csh.rit.edu),
[InterVarsity Christian Fellowship](http://www.rit.edu/ivcf/) and the [RIT Linux Users' Group](http://www.rit.edu/ritlug).

## Post-graduation ##

After graduating from RIT and spending two weeks wandering around Australia and New Zealand just for the fun of it, I started at
Datto where I remain employed today. I always said I wanted a quiet cottage in the woods but with fast Internet and close
proximity to an urban center; my current residence affords just that and more.

* Libertarianism
	* I do not associate or identify with any political party, but most of my beliefs line up with those of the [Libertarian Party](http://www.lp.org/). The amount of sense libertarianism makes causes me to wonder how so few have found it.
