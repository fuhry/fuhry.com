Faith
=====

It's rather uncommon for a "computer scientist" to be a Christian
in this day and age and I get asked a lot why I still adhere to
such a "broken" religion.

Couple reasons.

First, I see a beauty in humanity that is without a good
purely "chance-based" answer. To word it differently, humans are
so capable and smart, that it seems unlikely that we could have
just evolved from nothing, no matter how much time we were given
to do so. I believe people were created - and I hold an "artistic
genius" view of God, such that we are like a painting he created,
and the conflict between love for and pride over his work and
disappointment over his creation's turning away provides the
perfect backdrop for Christianity.

Second, while my background in the church matches many of the
Christian stereotypes in areas such as political beliefs, moral
directives and judgmental world-views, I have come to realize that
"he who is without sin shall cast the first stone." That is, no
Christian has the authority to judge other people except in very
limited capacity with other Christians.

Third, Christian morals (when applied properly) are an excellent
guide for making decisions. Be humble and respectful to everyone;
trust that God has everything under control and will give you
strength through trials and tough decisions; pour compassion on
those who hurt the most in your life. In short, live for others.
People who embody these traits are beautiful to me, and I can
only hope to possess all of these traits myself someday.

## Wait, that doesn't sound like most Christians I know. ##

If that's the case, I apologize on behalf of them. A quote from
Mohandas Gandhi sums up the situation perfectly:

> I like your Christ; I do not like your Christians. Your
> Christians are so unlike your Christ.

_(Full disclosure: the quote is disputed as having come from Gandhi,
but its message remains the same.)_

It's not the religion that's broken, it's the people who claim to
follow it.

If someone who claims to be a Christian speaks ill of you,
please recite them this verse:

> But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared
> to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason
> for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and
> respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak
> maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed
> of their slander.
> 
> _1 Peter 3:15-16 (NIV)_

That verse is an instruction to Christians to be unconditionally
respectful when defending their faith.

So I'm going to make a bold statement.

If someone tells you that God hates you or that you're going to
hell because you do X, Y or Z, then that person is in the wrong. In
fact, you should ask them if they really are Christians, if they're
acting like that.

First, God does not hate anybody. \*cough\*WBC\*cough\*

Second, while Christianity does hold that those who are not saved
will spend eternity in hell, it is not the duty of another Christian
to confront you about specific areas in your life where you might
be struggling with sin if you are not a Christian. Their job is to
represent Christian love - Christ's love - to you, so that you
wonder what it is that they've got that is so radiant and warm.

Christianity is about coming as you are, but not staying that way.

Once you are a Christian, you should want to get rid of sin on your
own. This is because "getting saved" is, by definition, recognizing
that you were created and that the one who created you has standards.
And just because you die before you've finished fully expunging
every trace of a particular struggle from your life does not mean
you're going to hell. At all.

Finally, since this is a hot topic in the Christian community right
now, I have serious reservations with typical Christian attitudes
towards specifically the LGBT community. I am proud to call a
multitude of gay, lesbian, bi and transgendered individuals true
friends, whom I confide in equally as much as many of my straight
friends.

## How can you stand churches? ##

I can't. At least, not most of them.

The church community I'm a part of right now is known as
[Sanctuary](https://www.facebook.com/wearesanctuary), a collection
of (mostly) young adults who love God _and_ others. At least half
of us, me included, are arguably "misfit" types. It's about as
much a church for weird people as you can get - but the doctrine
is sound and the love is unconditional.

And the music is loud.

I grew up in a
[much more conservative church](http://www.parksidechurch.com),
which I still largely agree with on the doctrinal front, but
Ohioans really are clueless about partying. In church, or
elsewhere.

## But the Old Testament says to... ##

The Bible is as much an historical document as a source of religious
instruction. God's Old Testament standards for the Jewish nation
were very different from the forgiving nature of the system put in
place by Jesus's death and resurrection.

So, don't go out and stone your kid because he used the f-word.

## But you listen to music that has Satanic lyrics! ##

It's true, I like Ghost and Moonsorrow, among countless other bands.
Did you know that Tchaikovsky was gay? Or that Richard Wagner was
a fiery antisemitist and authored pre-Nazi political writings?

I do not judge art or its creators by the ideas they represent or
hold. If I find beauty in a given work of art, I will appreciate
it whether or not it aligns with my beliefs.

Do I actually endorse that "hail Satan, devour us all" stuff in
Ghost's _Infestissumam_? Nope. It's all tongue-in-cheek anyway.
But it's good enjoyable music. And I've been listening to it for
years and have not once noticed it impacting my own beliefs.

## Concluding thoughts ##

I understand that the existence of God cannot be scientifically
proven. The Christian definition of God includes the trait
that he exists outside of the physical universe; as science is
capable only of observing the physical realm, science as we know
it is not qualified to determine God's existence.

I don't adhere to the idea that believing in the existence of
God without hard proof (scientific or otherwise) makes me a
"sheep" or gullible helpless fool. Friends and family have had
experiences that can't be easily explained within the bounds
of science. That's why they call it "faith." The very idea is
disgusting to some and a comfort to others; to analyze the idea of
faith itself is beyond the scope of this essay.

Christianity is not something everyone can get along with. I
fully realize this. I can't "convert" you.

If, however, you see something in Christianity that you want, talk
to me and I'll do my best to answer your questions.
