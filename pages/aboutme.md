Introduction
============

So I sort of lied about the "freelance web developer" part. I can do it (hence this website), and even consider myself highly skilled in the practice, but typically it's done as part of a larger project these days.

I was born in Cleveland, Ohio in early 1991, and home-schooled for most of my early years. Then when I was just turning 16, at the peak of socially-awkward-teenager period, I jumped into a local private high school from which I graduated 2 years later.

From there I started college at Rochester Institute of Technology, where I became involved with [Computer Science House](http://www.csh.rit.edu/), a collection of students who, like me, absolutely love hacking on projects. Some of my own projects are listed under the aptly named "projects" link to the left.

I graduated from RIT in May of 2013 with a degree in Computer Security (which is really a sysadmin/netadmin degree, with security as an afterthought). I currently am employed with [Datto Inc.](http://dattobackup.com/), a data backup startup, as an R&D software engineer.
