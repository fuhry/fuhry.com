			<h2>I'm a hacker and sysadmin.</h2>

			<p>I <a href="projects">write tools</a> that make building awesome functional networks easy. My skills in system
			administration, OS architecture, software engineering, web design, and networking can combine together
			to turn your complex integration and automation dreams into a reality.</p>
			
			<p>Currently I <a href="work">head up</a> the Advanced Research Group at <a href="http://dattobackup.com">Datto Inc.</a>,
			solving tough technical challenges and making our products more advanced than anything else out there. Some of my projects
			are Datto's remote access system that serves up to 2,500 simultaneous users on a daily basis, and the cloud based
			virtualization and file recovery platforms.</p>
			
			<p>Personal projects include an extensive single sign-on setup at my home, with a home-brewed, fully integrated captive
			portal and asset management UI, modifications to FreeRADIUS to support MSCHAPv2 authentication, and
			<a href="projects">more</a>. I'm all about finding new ways to tie strong security with a smooth user experience.</p>
			
			<p>I'm also a subject matter expert in
			<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/"><acronym title="Nullsoft Scriptable Install System">NSIS</acronym></a>, a widely
			used open source software installation toolkit, with over 10 years of experience developing highly specialized installers
			for Windows.</p>

			<h2>I'm a musician.</h2>

			<p>I play progressive and neo-classical metal on keys, but also am trying to catch up on the classical repertoire I largely
				abandoned as a kid. Current projects are mostly Beethoven's big three (Pathetique, Moonlight and Waldstein) but I hope
				to move into more modern compositions in the future.</p>
			
			<p>Meanwhile I am also involved with the awesome worship team at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/wearesanctuary">Sanctuary at Black Rock</a>.</p>
			
			<p>I've covered a bunch of metal songs on piano. Check out my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/danfuhry">YouTube channel</a> to see them. Most of my
				newer stuff is produced in my (relatively humble) home studio.</p>

			<h2>I'm an auto enthusiast.</h2>
			
			<p>I own two cars, a <a href="cars/ms3">2009 Mazdaspeed 3</a> and a <a href="/cars/gti">2002 Volkswagen GTI</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The Mazdaspeed 3, in Metropolitan Gray Mica, is my daily driver. Sporting Corksport's Stage II intake and rear motor mount, the car is
				largely stock but with those few small enhancements that bring the peppy little motor in that thing to life. I also designed a custom
				sound system, using components from Alpine and Infinity, that emphasizes quality over quantity.</p>
				
			<p>The GTI is a super-unique project car I took over from a friend. When I bought it, it ran (poorly) but that didn't last long - three months into
				owning the car, the timing skipped and all the exhaust valves got bent. So I had to put the car aside for a while. An ambitious rebuild using
				better-quality, higher-performance parts is currently underway. My future vision for this car is an E85-powered track monster with secret powers
				as an abominable snowmobile.</p>
