			<h2>Work &amp; Profession</h2>

			<p>My passion is for putting the "work" in "network." I love building systems that people are excited to use - from that
			magical single set of credentials to full network visibility for administrators. I strive to create the tools that give
			administrators confidence that their network is secure, always available, and perfectly balanced between control and
			simplicity.</p>
			
			<p>Currently I'm <a href="work">working with</a> the Advanced Research Team at <a href="http://datto.com">Datto</a>,
			solving tough technical challenges and making our products more advanced than anything else out there. Some of my projects
			are Datto's remote access system that serves over 3,000 simultaneous users on a daily basis, and the cloud based
			virtualization and file recovery platforms.</p>
			
			<p>Personal projects include an extensive single sign-on setup at my home, with a home-brewed, fully integrated captive
			portal and asset management UI, modifications to FreeRADIUS to support MSCHAPv2 authentication, and
			<a href="projects">more</a>. I'm all about finding new ways to tie strong security with a smooth user experience.</p>
			
			<p>I'm also a subject matter expert in
			<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/"><abbr title="Nullsoft Scriptable Install System">NSIS</abbr></a>, a widely
			used open source software installation toolkit, with over 10 years of experience developing highly specialized installers
			for Windows.</p>

			<h2>Music</h2>

			<p>I play progressive and neo-classical metal on keys, but also am trying to catch up on the classical repertoire I largely
				abandoned as a kid. Current projects are mostly Beethoven's big three (Pathetique, Moonlight and Waldstein) but I hope
				to move into more modern compositions in the future.</p>
			
			<p>Meanwhile I am also involved with the awesome worship team at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/wearesanctuary">Sanctuary at Black Rock</a>.</p>
			
			<p>I've covered a bunch of metal songs on piano. Check out my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/danfuhry">YouTube channel</a> to see them. Most of my
				newer stuff is produced in my (relatively humble) home studio.</p>

			<h2>Backyard Mechanic</h2>
			
			<p>I own two cars, a <a href="cars/ms3">2009 Mazdaspeed 3</a> and a <a href="/cars/gti">2002 Volkswagen GTI</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The Mazdaspeed 3, in Metropolitan Gray Mica, is my daily driver. The car is largely stock but with those few small enhancements that bring the peppy little
				motor in that thing to life: the Stage 2 intake and rear motor mount from Corksport, and a TWM short shift kit. I also designed a custom
				sound system, using components from Alpine and Infinity, that emphasizes quality over quantity.</p>
				
			<p>The GTI is a super-unique project car I took over from a friend. When I bought it, it ran (poorly) but that didn't last long - three months into
				owning the car, the timing skipped and all the exhaust valves got bent. So I had to put the car aside for a while. An ambitious rebuild using
				better-quality, higher-performance parts is currently underway. The car runs and drives, but I'm not going to stop there. My future vision for
				this car is an E85-powered track monster with secret powers as an abominable snowmobile.</p>
